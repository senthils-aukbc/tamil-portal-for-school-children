title: "Tamil portal for school children"
subtitle: Creating and Deploying a free Tamil Portal to serve the Educational, Cultural and Recreational needs of under privileged school children
blurb:
    heading: The background
    text: "Unlike in the case of schools for the well to do, for children from poorer backgrounds the school experience mostly get restricted to class rooms, textbooks and exams. Co/extra - curricular activities barely exist beyond paper for most of them. Given their economic status, their homes too often do not have a supportive environment to expand the child's mental horizon beyond the curricular content. And increasingly, there are no grand parents staying with them who otherwise were storehouses of stories, songs, folklore etc., contributing to the cultural, recreational and social growth of the children. Even when the young parents do want to make available culturally and socially rich and relevant material in Tamil for their children, they are mostly unaware of where they can find them and how to access them easily. This is unlike in the case of children from well to do families whose parents have access to such rich material easily available in English."
intro:
    heading: "The Present Project"
    text: "This project attempts to address this issue, and is building an App-based portal in Tamil that provides free access to educational, cultural and recreational content appropriate for children in the form of stories, songs, music, audio, videos, movies, cartoons, animation films, etc. With the help of educationists and social workers, we would classify the contents into levels that would be appropriate to a specified class/age group, such as LKG/UKG, standards 1-2, 3-5, 5-8 etc. The portal is not expected to be accessed directly by the children, but by their parents who will select the items that they want their children to see using the cell phone. As all the contents on this portal would have been carefully selected and assembled, parents need not have any concerns regarding their appropriateness for their children. The target users of this portal would thus be young parents who would like their children to grow up with good exposure to quality cultural and recreational content in Tamil such as stories, music, dance, cartoons etc.-- what would have been traditionally provided by the grandparents, older relatives, neighbours, etc. Access to the portal will be free of cost to all."
