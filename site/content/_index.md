blurb:
    heading: The background
    text: "Unlike in the case of schools for the well to do, for children from poorer backgrounds the school experience mostly get restricted to class rooms, textbooks and exams. Co/extra - curricular activities barely exist beyond paper for most of them. Given their economic status, their homes too often do not have a supportive environment to expand the child's mental horizon beyond the curricular content. And increasingly, there are no grand parents staying with them who otherwise were storehouses of stories, songs, folklore etc., contributing to the cultural, recreational and social growth of the children. Even when the young parents do want to make available culturally and socially rich and relevant material in Tamil for their children, they are mostly unaware of where they can find them and how to access them easily. This is unlike in the case of children from well to do families whose parents have access to such rich material easily available in English."

    heading: Our values
    text: Coffee is an amazing part of human culture but it has a dark side too – one of colonialism and mindless abuse of natural resources and human lives. We want to turn this around and return the coffee trade to the drink’s exhilarating, empowering and unifying nature.
